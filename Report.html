  <h3>4.1 Mock-up stage</h3>
  <p>
    During the mock-up stage, we have developed mock-ups of the pages of the application.
    This is an important step during the development of a product, for the reason that the process of technical implementation relies on and is lead by the sketches designed during this stage.
