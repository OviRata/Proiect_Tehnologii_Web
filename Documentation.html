  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

  <h3 id="motivation">1.1 Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    The presented software product, titled <i>Web Garden</i>, allows users to use a wide variety of functionalities.
    The main purpose of the project, is to create a platform, that allows the users to buy and sell flowers, quickly and securely.
    The user can create an account on our platform, which will allow him to participate in the flower market, and buy or sell any avaliable amount of flowers.
    The website also allows users to manage their own garden, and to determine which flowers are still growing, and which are ready for cultivation and selling.
    The stage of development of the flowers is determined based on the color saturation, obtained after analyzing the images of the garden, obtained from sensors or cameras, placed around it by the user.
    Users will get email and browser notifications, when flowers become ready for cultivation and selling, and when orders are placed for the flowers they sell.
    The notifications can be viewed in the user's email, and also on our website.
  </p>

  <h3 id="target-audience">1.2 Target Audience</h3>
  <p>
    Our product is intended for people that are directly involved in the flower market, that need to sell or buy flowers as efficiently as possible, and who can use some help with growing flowers and gardening.
    Casual users, that just ocasionally need to buy some flowers, are also welcome on our website, which provides easy-to-use and efficient interfaces, which helps them find the best prices for any flower they may need.

  <h2>4. Development History</h2>

  <h3 id="mockup-stage">4.1 Mock-up stage</h3>
  <p>
    During the mock-up stage, we have developed mock-ups of the pages of the application.
    This is an important step during the development of a product, for the reason that the process of technical implementation relies on and is lead by the sketches designed during this stage.
    Some of them can be viewed below:

  <h3 id="product-card">
    4.2.1 Product Cards
  </h3>
  <p>
    During the front end development stage, an automated solution for generating and displaying product/user cards has been implemented.
  </p>

  <h3 id="shopping-cart-implementation">
    4.2.2 Shopping Cart Implementation
  </h3>
  <p>
    The logic behind the shopping cart, relies mainly on the front-end part of our project. It has been implemented in such a manner, that it is persistent, while the user is logged. The prodduct cart can be updated by adding more items from the list of products. The quantity of a specific item can be increased, decreased, or the item can be completely removed from the current shopping cart option.
    Also, after the order is placed, an email is sent to the address of the current logged user, about the products he has ordered.
  </p>


  <h3 id="role-separation-implementation">
    4.2.3 Role-Separation
  </h3>
  <p>
    The key feature which relies on the front end of our application, is the role-separation.
    A user can have some possible roles, which he can choose during the registration process (client/vendor).
    When starting the application, the default role is set to notlogged.
    In the dataBase, there exists a special user, which has the role 'admin'. This is the user, which, while logged in, can manage the application from a panel on the front-end.
    The role separation affects such properties as: the pages where links lead, what functionalities are available to the user, what types of notification a user can receive.
  </p>

  <h3 id="database">
    4.3.1 Database
  </h3>
  <p>
  For this project, we have used MongoDB as the database. Unlike Oracle, Postgres or MySql, MongoDB is a non-relational database, which stores data as documents rather than tables.
    We have decided to use this specific database manager, because we were interested in learning how to work with a new type of databases, as we have worked with relational databases at 3 other courses during the last semesters.
    In order to access and use the database via node.js, we have used the Mongoose library.
    In our MongoDB database, we have 3 collections: users/products and notifications. Their names are suggestive, regarding the data that is stored inside them.

<section id="system-features">
  <h2>5. System features</h2>
  <h3>5.1 Login/Logout</h3>
  <p>The website allows a user to log in and out of the application. Having an account is mandatory in order to access to full suite of features in the app. In order to login, the user must provide their email or username, together with the password associated with their account. Also, as a security measure, the passwords are stored as hashs in the database.</p>

  <h3>5.2 Sign Up</h3>
  <p>In order to sign up, a client who is not already a registered user must navigate to the Sign Up page and introduce the following details: email address, full name, username and password. The user also chooses a role for using the website: client or vendor, which is unchangeable. Moreover, the login/register input data is validated in order to weaken brute-force vulnerabilities probabilities.  </p>

  <h3>5.3 Follow the development of flowers</h3>
  <p>A user logged in as vendor has access to its plants. The user can view its own plants, for each stage ('planted', 'grown' or 'for sale'). Each plant gets registered in the database. A vendor can add plants by a form with relevant inputs such as water, soil, temperature, name and image.</p>

  <h3>5.4 Order flowers</h3>
  <p>A logged in client can 'Add to cart' any flower for sale reported by any vendor. After proceeding with the shopping cart, the user gets an email with the details of the order.</p>

  <h3>5.5 Sell flowers</h3>
  <p>In order to sell a flower, the logged-in user (with a 'vendor' role) can either add a plant directly for sale or can modify the state of a grown plants (or all grown plants) to being for sale. The product page is automatically modified after each 'Move to sale' operation. </p>

  <h3>5.6 Receive notifications about your flowers</h3>
  <p>
    All notifications are received by a sensor microservice, at any time and updates the notifications data base accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The notification page displays data from the notifications database, for a 'vendor' user, all notifications regarding its products are displayed, while for a 'client' user, the notification displayed are only the ones for favorite products (option available within a 'Add to favorites' button for each product and stored in the local storage).

  <h2>6. Non-functional requirements</h2>
  <h3 id="performance-requirements"> 6.1 Performance Requirements  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The site and all its pages  is responsive on all main types of display resolutions, whether it's Phone, Tablet, Laptop or Desktop. Obscure devices such as your bootleg wireless earphones with a display on the case and internet access do not count.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="security-requirements"> 6.2 Security Requirements  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Passwords will not be stored in the database, but rather their hashed version.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Every information entered by the user shall follow GDPR regulations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For injection prevention (SQL, OS or XSS), we chose to have whitelists and blacklists configured for the project. The white list is configured by a python script outside the project environment, while the blacklist is configured to contain all back end development files.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Before sending a login/register requests that queries the database, the client runs a input validator in order to prevent as many special characters common in XSS or SQL as possible (e.g. '<','>','(',')',';')</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Authorization is assured by using JWTs during requests that manipulate user data.
